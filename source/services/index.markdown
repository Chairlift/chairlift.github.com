[Chairlift Development](http://chairliftdevelopment.com) specializes in delivering custom, scalable solutions using Ruby on Rails, PHP, SQL, and related technologies. We are committed to working side-by-side with our clients to design, develop, and implement innovative solutions to suit their individual needs.

We begin each project by reviewing existing operating procedures and evaluating our clientsâ€™ current and future needs. We then translate those requirements into concrete strategic and technical solutions to expedite workflow, improve communication, and enhance productivity.

Committed to excellence in our craft, we are passionate about delivering beautifully-designed, robust solutions and take great pride in maintaining strong, ongoing relationships with our clients.

Chairlift Development is directed by Bent Cardan, lift operator, lead developer and web application architect. Bent has been developing web sites and providing IT robust solutions since the late 90s. He is the author of Chairlift Development Blog and creator of many great websites.

Our custom solutions include elegant, powerful, and easy-to-use applications that include e-commerce, content and event management, client and portfolio presentations, and blogs, forums and social networking applications.
